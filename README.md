*** README FOR RESPONSAGRAM ***

Everything you need is in the zip when you download. Include main.js and all of the html in index.html. Oauth token will expire so get a new one. CSS tweak points are at the bottom of the CSS. This is just meant to be a quick and dirty responsive web app.

//** INSTRUCTIONS **//
Change the data attribute in index.html to the hashtag you would like to find. Set it and forget it.
